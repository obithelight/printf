# 0x11. C - printf

- In the C programming language, **printf** is a function that is used to format and print text or other data to the standard output (usually the console). It stands for "**print formatted**" and is part of the standard C library header file called (`stdio.h`). 
- **Printf** allows you to combine text and variables in a specific format and then display the formatted output on the screen or in a file.

## Project Concept
	Write a custom-made printf function that displays formated text to the standard output.

## Objectives
- Use various flags and modifiers to control the formatting of the output, such as specifying when to print a single character, an integer, a formatted string, a sentence, decimal places for floating-point numbers, or the width of output fields. The printf function should provide a powerful way to format and display output well-organized.

## Edge Cases to Consider
	Percent (%)
	Float output
	String output
	Integer output
 	length of input
	Character output
	Variable addresses
	Hexadecimal numbers
