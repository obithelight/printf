# 0x11. C - printf
- C Group project

- In the C programming language, **printf** is a function that is used to format and print output to the console. It stands for "**print formatted**." It allows you to combine text and variables in a specific format and then display the formatted output on the screen or in a file.

## Project Concept
	Write your own printf function.

## Objectives
- Use various flags and modifiers to control the formatting of the output, such as specifying when to print a single character, an integer, a formatted string, a sentence, decimal places for floating-point numbers or the width of output fields. The printf function should provide a powerful way to format and display output in a well-organized manner.

## Edge Cases to Consider
	Percent (%)
	Float output
	String output
	Integer output
 	length of input
	Character output
	Variable addresses
	Hexadecimal numbers
